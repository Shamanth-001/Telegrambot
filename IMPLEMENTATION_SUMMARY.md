# Automated Movie Download System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Created Automated Streaming Downloader
**File: `src/services/automatedStreamDownloader.js`**
- Uses Puppeteer with stealth plugin for anti-detection
- Tries multiple streaming sites: FlixHQ, SolarMovie, ZoeChip
- Captures HLS/m3u8 streams via request interception
- Downloads with ffmpeg for proper full-length movies
- Validates file size > 500MB for real movies
- Returns full movie path and metadata

### 2. Updated DownloaderBot Logic
**File: `src/bot/downloaderBot.js`**

#### Added Methods:
- `downloadTorrentFile()` - Downloads .torrent files (not movies)
- `uploadTorrentToChannel()` - Uploads torrent files to channel

#### Updated Methods:
- `downloadFromTorrent()` - Now returns torrent files when seeders >= 15
- `downloadFromStreaming()` - Now uses automated streaming downloader
- `downloadMovie()` - Completely rewritten with new flow

### 3. New Download Flow

#### For Movies with High Seeders (>= 15):
1. Search torrents → Find results with 150+ seeders
2. Download .torrent file only (NOT the movie)
3. Upload .torrent to private channel
4. Send .torrent file to user with message: "150 seeders - use uTorrent"

#### For Movies with Low Seeders (< 15):
1. Search torrents → Find results with 8 seeders
2. Fall back to streaming sites
3. Use automated Puppeteer + stream capture
4. Download full movie (1-4GB) from FlixHQ/SolarMovie/ZoeChip
5. Upload full movie to private channel
6. Send movie to user

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### User searches "The Prestige 2006":
1. Bot checks channel cache → not found
2. Bot searches torrents → finds results with 8 seeders
3. Seeders < 15 → Bot downloads full movie from FlixHQ (1.2GB)
4. Bot uploads movie to private channel
5. Bot sends movie to user

### User searches "Interstellar 2014":
1. Bot checks channel cache → not found
2. Bot searches torrents → finds results with 150 seeders  
3. Seeders >= 15 → Bot downloads .torrent file only
4. Bot uploads .torrent to channel
5. Bot sends .torrent file to user with message "150 seeders - use uTorrent"
