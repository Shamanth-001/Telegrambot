# 🎬 Corrected Flow - No Local Torrent Download

## ✅ **CORRECTED FLOW**

You're absolutely right! Here's the **corrected flow**:

```
User: /cache "KGF 2"
  ↓
1. Check cache → Not found
  ↓  
2. Search torrents → Found!
  ↓
3. Send torrent files directly to user (NO local download)
  ↓
4. User downloads torrent files to their device
  ↓
5. User uses their torrent client to download movie
  ↓
6. If no torrents found → Try streaming fallback
  ↓

```
